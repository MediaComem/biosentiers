## Questions

* Est-ce que les événements doivent être loggés dès que l'action est entreprise ou seulement lorsque l'action est validée (genre les actions qui ont un impact sur la BD) ?
* Mettre les événements du cycle de vie d'une excursion dans action ou dans lifecycle ? (Je penche pour lifecycle)
